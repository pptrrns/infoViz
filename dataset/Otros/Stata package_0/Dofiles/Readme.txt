To run the codes, it is necessary to change the paths at the beginning of each file.
Dofiles can be run directly from the dofile or by using the master dofile. 
Take into account that some of them, especially number 2 and 7, can take a few hours to run.
To reproduce the process, they must be executed following the sequence indicated by the number in the file name. 
However, the intermediate output files are also provided so the dofiles can be run independently form each other (except 5 that should go after 4).
